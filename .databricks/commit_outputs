 # .databricks/commit_outputs file is used to control whether a notebooks' output should be included when committing changes to Git.
 #
 # Reference:
 # each line in .databricks/commit_outputs represents a glob pattern
 # line starting with # represents a comment
 # notebook that matches a glob pattern will have output included
 # line starting with ! represents a exclusion pattern (i.e. !folder_a/\* will exclude output for all notebooks in folder_a)
 # if a notebook path matches multiple glob patterns, the last matching glob pattern will be used

 # The following pattern will include output for all notebooks
